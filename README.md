## 📂 Internship Tasks  

### 🏠 Task 1: House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)  
**Objective:** Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.  

**Key Steps**  
- Preprocessed and analyzed a real estate dataset  
- Implemented **Linear Regression** with scikit-learn  
- Applied **feature engineering (log transforms)** for improved accuracy  
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices  

**Results**  
- **R² score = 0.72** (70%+ variance explained)  
- Identified **GrLivArea (sq ft)** as the strongest predictor  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 🛍️ Task 2: Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)  
**Objective:** Segment mall customers based on annual income and spending score for targeted marketing.  

**Key Steps**  
- Explored the **Mall Customers dataset**  
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine k=5 clusters  
- Visualized clusters with centroids for interpretability  

**Insights: 5 Customer Segment Profiles**  
1. 💼 High income, cautious spenders  
2. 👑 High income & high spenders (premium customers)  
3. 🙂 Moderate income & spending (average customers)  
4. 🛒 Low income but high spenders (budget-conscious)  
5. 🙁 Low income & low spenders  

**Business Value**  
- Enables **personalized marketing campaigns**  
- Optimizes **product placement**  
- Improves **customer retention**  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 🐶🐱 Task 3: Dog vs Cat Classification (Hybrid CNN + SVM)  
**Objective:** Classify dog and cat images using a hybrid ML/DL approach.  

**Approach**  
- Preprocessed image dataset  
- Extracted deep features using a **CNN-based feature extractor**  
- Trained an **SVM classifier** on extracted features  
- Evaluated performance on the test dataset  

**Results**  
- Achieved **65% test accuracy**  
- Demonstrated potential of **hybrid CNN + SVM models** in image classification  

**Key Takeaway:** Classical algorithms (SVM) can remain competitive when fused with modern deep learning feature extractors.  

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn

### ✋ Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition (CNN)  
**Objective:** Classify **10 hand gestures** from the LeapGestRecog dataset for human-computer interaction (HCI).  

**Key Steps**  
- Preprocessed thousands of gesture images  
- Built a **CNN architecture** with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers  
- Trained and validated the model with high accuracy  

**Results**  
- Training Accuracy: **99.22%**  
- Test Accuracy: **99.25%** 🚀  

**Business & Technical Insights**  
- Enables **gesture-based interfaces (HCI)**  
- Applications in **sign language recognition** & **robotics**  
- Strong demonstration of **Deep Learning + Computer Vision**  

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib
